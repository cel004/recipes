        <h3><strong>description</strong></h3>
        <p>This is a recipe passed down from my Mom. Every time I make it, someone asks for the recipe. One friend says her family fights over it!</p> 
            <p>I hope you enjoy! You can also make a homemade chicken soup with this recipe.</p> 
            <p>Just cut up veggies, shred chicken, and cook in chicken broth.</p>
